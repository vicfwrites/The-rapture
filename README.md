# The Rapture: What Really Occurred?

They say the rapture is a myth. That's it's a fairytale only found in the Christian Bible.

But that's a lie.

Not from where I come from.

The Rapture occurred before my eyes.

I saw my neighbourhood disappear.

November 21st, 2024.

That was the date.

The rapture is a spiritual event prophesied by Jesus and his disciples where God's saints were taken from this earth and catapulted to heaven via God's angels via an ascension.

## When did the rapture take place?

God has a secret plan. To rapture a small group of people first before he raptures the whole world. My neighborhood was picked. He raptured my closest neighbors, my family and almost my entire state. 

This particular rapture occurred on November 21st, 2024.

## Who am I to make such bold claims?

I'm a boy, 24 of age. I was left behind to witness the rapture happen before my eyes. God showed me visions of heaven. Heaven is far more beautiful than anything you can imagine.

## Why did God rapture people?

This is the end times. And in the end times, terrible things have been prophesied to happen.

God wants to wipe the world and rebuild it anew.

But sudden swift destruction, judgment and chaos awaits the earth and its inhabitants before this.

So God will take his people away so they won't have to suffer the terrible fate that awaits the world.

## Will the rapture happen again?

Yes, the rapture will happen again. God has not revealed to me the next date of the rapture. But it's coming. Life on your earth will not be as usual once it happens. This time the entire world will be raptured.

## Is there any sign of the end times?

There are so many signs of the end times.

From my simple observance of the world and from what the Holy Spirit inspired me to know and revealed to me.

We are in the end times.

The first two Trumpets prophesied in the Christian Bible has already been blown and its prophecies fulfilled.

## What are the prophecies being fulfilled?

1. Revelation 8:7 NKJV

[7] The first angel sounded: And hail and fire followed, mingled with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. And a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.

This happened in 2021.

Where most of the largest forests were scorched by fire including Amazon . This in total equates to about ⅓ of vegetation in the world.

2. Revelation 8:8-9 NKJV
[8] Then the second angel sounded: And something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood. [9] And a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.

This also happened in 2021. Where a large number of volcanoes became active and erupted. It was also recorded in many parts of the world where seas were turning red and rivers red like blood. This occurred in many places.

A certain occurrence also took place in a certain ocean where a large number of marine life died from the radiating heat and larva from the earth crust. This equates to almost ⅓ of marine life.

The last prophecy is yet to be fulfilled.

## What will happen after the rapture?

Nothing but chaos and destruction.

How can one be saved from the Chaos and destruction?

Through Jesus.

Jesus is the only way one can be saved.

He is the one that raptured people.

Believing in him and asking for his forgiveness is the only way one can be saved.

### Pray this prayer before it is too late:

Lord Jesus, I'm sorry for my sins. And I accept you as my Personal Lord and Savior. Come into my life. I'm ready to do your will. Thank you for accepting me. In Jesus name I pray. Amen.

## Is there more that I should know?

God marked his elect (his saints) with a seal. If anyone prays the prayer of Jesus' acceptance and forgiveness he will be given a mark.

## What happens if I don't receive the mark?

Terrible things will happen.

The rapture might happen for the second if not for the last time.

You might miss it.

And anyone that misses the rapture is doomed to receive the dreaded mark of the beast (666).

## What is the mark of the beast?

The mark of the beast is a demonic mark designed by Satan to force people into hell with him. He knows his time is up and is doing everything to pull in as much people with him into hell.

It is prophesied, in the last days, people can't buy or sell without the mark of the beast. It is forced down on people's throats.

And anyone one who receives it is doomed for condemnation unless they receive God's mark.

## Will the rapture happen again?

Yes, it will.

But for the second or last time.

No one knows except Jesus.

## Who is Jesus?

Jesus is the son of God who created the universe.

In the last days, it will be like the time of Noah. People ate & drank, partied to their fill and mocked Noah's divine instruction to build the ark and refused to enter until Noah's ark got shut by God and a terrible flood wiped them off the face of the earth.

In our time, Jesus is our Noah's ark.

Get into him before it is too late.
